	<h1>Married Five, Together Eleven</h1>
	
	<p>Eleven years now and we're both like... "So when does the honeymoon phase wear off?" Our relationship is positive, our life together spontaneous and playful, our energy is as sexy as ever, and the romance seems to intensify rather than dwindle, even after all this time. It's like we've only just begun dating and like we've known each other a lifetime, simultaneously.</p>	
	
	<p>Cheers to another marriage anniversary!<br>
	Here’s to year five… Wood.</p>

	<h1>Married Four, Together Ten</h1>
	
	<p>Our life together is like recess. Free of responsibility, festive, and celebratory.<br>
	Our life together is like dance. Passionate, intimate, and adventurous.<br>
	And today we celebrate a decade, solid, fortified, and beautiful.</p>
	
	<p>Cheers to another marriage anniversary!<br>
	Here’s to year four… Fruit/Flower.</p>

	<h1>Married Three, Together Nine</h1>
	
	<p>To look back at our relationship, is to look at it now. And to look forward, is as simple as putting emphasis on the things we're currently passionate about. The past left nothing to long for and the future is clearly written in the lines of our palms, intertwined and fortified as we hold hands. The present defines it all.</p>
	
	<p>We were shy around each other once, we still are, and we will find moments of shyness later. We laughed together, we still do, and wrinkles of laughter will plague us in our old age. We were passionate once, we still are, and we'll continue to explore our freakiness. We loved each other once, we still do, and later, we'll have to find a word that better describes how amazing it all is.</p>
	
	<p>We've spent nine years together, celebrating every day along the way. Today is no different. And tomorrow, the celebration only continues.</p>
	
	<p>Here's to another official year of marriage, here's to year three... Leather.</p>

	<h1>Married Two, Together Eight</h1>
	
	<p>The honeymoon stage is a myth. Eight years later and it still feels as if we’ve just begun dating. Sure, we may know each other better and we live together now, but there’s still excitement — There’s still that playful shyness, there’s still passion. The celebration seems forever continuous, as we begin another year together.</p>
	
	<p>It’s officially our second marriage anniversary, and it only continues to get better.<br>
	Here’s to year two… Cotton.</p>

	<h1>Married One, Together Seven</h1>
	
	<p>It's officially been a year, but we've been going strong for seven. Marriage stereotypes do not apply here, nothing's changed. We celebrate life daily and we celebrate each other, just like we always have. However, this is our first time celebrating an anniversary, and we're excited.</p>
	
	<p>Here's to year one... Paper.</p>
